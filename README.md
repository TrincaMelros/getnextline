# getnextline
Short function in C to return a line for @42Lisboa

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor. This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming:
static variables.
